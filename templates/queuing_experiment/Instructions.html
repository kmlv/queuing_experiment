<p>
    Welcome, and thank you for participating!
    <br><br>
    From now until the end of the experiment, please stay focused on the task at hand, as your
    payment highly depends on your performance in the experiment. To respect other participants,
    please do not eat, play, chat, or leave the room during the experiment. If you need to drink 
    water or use your cellphone, please only do so when absolutely necessary. If you have any
    questions, please send the experimenter a private message. Please also remember to open the session 
    link with Chrome because other browsers may cause problems.
    During the experiment, you will earn points in each round. At the end of the 
    experiment, two rounds will be randomly chosen, from which your points will be 
    converted to PEN (200 lab points = 10 PEN). You are guaranteed a show-up 
    fee of 5.00 PEN but can earn considerably more. 
</p>

<h3>Game Overview</h3>
<p>
    In this experiment, you will interact with other participants in multiple rounds. In 
    each round, you will be grouped randomly and anonymously with several other participants. 
    All of you will be placed randomly in a line waiting for a “service”, where your position 
    in the line determines the value of the service. Naturally, the closer to 
    the front of the line you are, the higher value you can receive at the end of the 
    round. The value of the service differs between participants. During each round, you 
    can also exchange your positions with other participants in the line under some 
    specific exchange rules. Your round payoff is determined by the service value you 
    receive and the potential transfers you can get from the exchange rule.

    <br><br>
    In particular, your payoff in each round will be given by:
</p>

<p>
    <b>Endowment + Value of Final Position + Transfers you receive - Transfers you send 
    </b>
    <ul>
        <li>Endowment is the payoff you own at the beginning of each round.</li>
        <li>Value is the value of the service based on your final position in the line.</li>
        <li>Transfers you receive is an accumulation of the transfers received from other players 
            when you agree to move back in line.</li>
        <li>Transfers you send is the total amount you have sent to other players 
            while moving forward in the line.</li>
    </ul>
    Your final payment in this experiment = your show-up fee + your payoff in two random rounds.
</p>

<h3>User Interface</h3>

<img src="{% static 'interface.png' %}"/> 

<p>
    At the beginning of each round, the random line is placed on top of the screen. 
    The line of circles shows the current status of the line. The number of circles 
    shows the number of participants in your group. The position is the number inside 
    each circle, with your circle being shaded red (as shown above). The purple 
    circles are the people that are ahead of you in the line and with whom you may 
    initiate an interaction. The gray circles represent the people that are behind 
    you in the line. In the example above, you are the 4th person in line and may 
    initiate interactions with the people in the 1st through 3rd spots.
</p>
<p>
    Below each position, you can see the value associated with it if you hold that 
    position at the end of the round (note that the values differ between participants). 
    The closer is your final position to the front,  
    the higher the value associated with it. The information above the line of circles 
    in the user interface shows the current round number, the current exchange rule, 
    whether messaging is allowed, and the remaining time of the current round.
</p>

<img src="{% static 'interface2.png' %}"/>

<p>
    Below the line, you can see the decision panel. Depending on the exchange rules, 
    different buttons will be visible in the decision panel. To interact with someone 
    in line, simply click on the corresponding circle. For example, to interact with 
    the person in the 3rd position in the line, click on the circle with 3 in it, then 
    complete the rest of the items in the box (offer/message) and press “Send your 
    request”. After doing so, the button will turn red and offer the chance to “Cancel 
    your request”. It is possible that the other participant just ignores your request, 
    but you can cancel your request at any time. If messaging is enabled, you can also 
    attach a message with your request using the right side of the panel.

</p>

<img src="{% static 'interface3.png' %}"/>

<p>
    Below the decision panel, you can see the request panel and the history panel. On 
    the left is the request panel. You can see your own current exchange request on 
    top of the panel, and requests from others below it. You can only send out one 
    request to move forward at a time. However, you may receive requests from multiple 
    others at the same time. When you accept a request, other requests (including your 
    own request) will be automatically canceled. For example, in the request panel 
    above, you can see that you haven’t sent any request yet, and there are two exchange 
    requests from the participants at position 5 and 6 with offers and messages.
    The informaiton of the request may differ between exchange rules.
</p>
<p>
    On the right, you can observe your endowment, current total transfer, and your own 
    exchange history in the current round. Once a request has been responded to, a new 
    row will appear in the “Exchange History” box. Four pieces of information will be 
    reported: your original position, your new position, the status of the response, 
    and the transfer made (if any). For example, the figure below shows a few responses 
    for this player. The first row shows that this player’s request was rejected, 
    meaning they stayed in the same position (as the row reports). The second row 
    indicates that the player in position 4 accepted this player’s request and the 
    transfer is 8 points from this player to the player in position 4.
</p>

<h3>Exchange Rules:</h3>

{% if swap_method == "TL"  %}
    <p>
        Take/Leave Price (TL):
    </p>

    <img src="{% static 'interface4.png' %}"/>

    <p>
        In this experiment, you can send an exchange offer to other participants with a 
        price. If your offer is accepted and you exchange positions, you will pay the 
        accepted amount to the other participant and your service value will increase 
        since you are moving forward in the line. If you exchange positions and move 
        backward, your value will decrease but you will gain a transfer equal to the 
        offer you accepted. The other participants can also send you their requests with 
        offers. Technically speaking, you need to find the opportunity to earn payoff by 
        requesting to move forward or accepting someone’s request.
    </p>

    <img src="{% static 'interface5.png' %}"/>

    <p>
        For example, suppose you are the 4th person in the line. If you want to switch 
        with the participant at position 2, you will earn 45-27=18 more service value if 
        the exchange succeeds. So your offer should be below 18. Otherwise, you will lose 
        money even if you move to position 2. If the participant at position 5 offers you 
        a request, you shouldn’t accept it when the offer is below 9, as you will lose 
        27-18=9 points if you exchange positions.
    </p>

{% elif swap_method == "swap" %}
    <p>
        Swap (swap):
    </p>

    <img src="{% static 'interface6.png' %}" />

    <p>
        In this experiment, you can exchange positions with other participants by sending 
        out your request and accepting others’ requests. The exchange of positions will 
        affect your position in the line, thus affect your service value. However, there 
        is no monetary transfer between participants during each exchange. You cannot get
        any transfer from other participants and you cannot send any transfer to others. 

    </p>

{% elif swap_method == "Double" %}

    <p>
        DA:
    </p>

    <img src="{% static 'interface_double1.PNG' %}"/>

    <p>
        In this experiment, participants can send exchange offers to other participants with a Bid. 
        Instead of accepting/declining the bid, the other participant’s exchange request looks as follows.
    </p>

    <img src="{% static 'interface_double2.PNG' %}"/>

    <p>
        The other participant needs to offer an Ask price by filling in the blank and pressing the Ask button. 
        If the Ask is NOT higher than the Bid, the exchange request will be accepted. Both participants switch 
        positions and the average of the Ask and the Bid is transferred from the requester to the requestee. 
        On one hand, the requester will pay the transfer to the requestee but her value from the position will 
        increase since she is moving forward in the line. On the other hand, the requestee’s value will decrease 
        but she will gain the transfer. Technically speaking, you need to find the opportunity to earn payoff by 
        requesting to move forward or placing the right Ask for someone’s request. If the Ask is higher than the Bid, 
        the request will be rejected. The requestee cannot observe the Bid when choosing the Ask.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, let us say that the requester sends an exchange request with a bid of 10. 
        If the requestee chooses an Ask of 9, they will exchange positions with a transfer of 9.5. 
        If the requestee chooses 11 instead, the exchange request will be automatically rejected.
    </p>

    <img src="{% static 'interface_double3.png' %}"/>

    <p>
        The participants can request the exchange with any other participants in the line and 
        the “value” of the exchange may vary. For example, suppose you are the 4th person in the line. 
        If you want to switch with the participant at position 2, you will earn 50-30=20 more service 
        value if the exchange succeeds. If the final transfer is more than 20, 
        you will lose money even if you move to position 2. If the participant at position 5 
        offers you a request, the final transfer should not be lower than 10, as you will 
        lose 30-20=10 points if you exchange positions.
    </p>

{% endif %}

<h3>Messaging</h3>

<p>
    In some rounds, you are allowed to attach a message to your exchange request. 
    The other participant can see your message with the exchange request. You can also 
    see other participants’ messages when they send you their exchange request. The 
    message option is on the right side of the decision panel.
    You can use either English or Spanish during the messaging.
</p>

<img src="{% static 'msg.png' %}"/>

<p>
    Please follow the two rules when you message others:

    <ol>
        <li>Discrimination and malicious messages are NOT allowed.</li>
        <li>Do NOT directly or indirectly disclose your identity.</li>
    </ol>
    Participants who send these types of messages will not get their payment and will 
    be removed from the participant pool of the lab. If you find some messages 
    uncomfortable, you can also report the message using the report button in the 
    request panel.
